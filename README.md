## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunal768/NCAA_Basketball_Stats.git
cd NCAA_Basketball_Stats
```


### 2. Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+** (with pip)
- **BigQuery Account** ([Sign Up](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery))
- **Google Cloud SDK** (optional)

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 4. BigQuery Setup
1. Create Service Account and download JSON credentials
2. Place auth file in project root:
```bash
cp /path/to/your-credentials.json ./gcp_credentials.json
```
3. To create a partition in a bigquery dataset, which is required to run team performance metrics APIs, you need to follow instructions from the pdf file "InstructionsForPartitioning.pdf".

### 5. Environment Configuration
Create `.env` file with:
```env
PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
CRED_FILE_PATH=./gcp_credentials.json
TEAM_NAME_MAP=./notebooks/team_mappings.json
PREDICTION_MODEL=./notebooks/ncaa_model.pkl
```


### 6. Launch Development Server
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```


### 7. Access API Documentation
